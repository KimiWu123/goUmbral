goUmbral is a Go implementation of David Nuñez's threshold proxy re-encryption scheme: [Umbral][1].
Implemented with [OpenSSL][2], goUmbral is an open-source cryptography library based on the referential
python library, [pyUmbral][3].

goUmbral is still in major development and the API in considered unstable. It will be changing a lot.

Quick Installation
------------------

OpenSSL is a required dependency. OpenSSL versions 1.1.0+ work but it is recommended to install OpenSSL version 1.1.1.

Install OpenSSL system wide or link to your local installation in the build.go file of umbral.

The NuCypher team uses Go for managing goUmbral's dependencies.
The recommended installation procedure is as follows:

`go get -u github.com/nucypher/goUmbral/umbral`

Then just include the package at the top of your file:

`import "github.com/nucypher/goUmbral/umbral"`

> For Windows:
> Change cgo flags to `LDFLAGS: -llibcrypto` in build.go

> For Mac:
> OpenSSL 1.1 or above is necessay. Apple's official support version would  causes link errors.
> If two or above OpenSSL version exists, link path should be specified with `LDFLAGS`
> Example: `LDFLAGS: -L/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/lib -lcrypto`
